# Q&A

- **1.How to get the recipe?**

  After you install the datapack/mod, when you get the ingredients in each recipe, you can see the recipe in the tooltip.

- **2.Where can I check out the recipes that are included in Better Crafting Recipe?**

  In Github Wiki of the whwdzg/better-crafting-recipes repo
**(Not Finished Yet)**.

- **3.How can I get the advncemnets of the recipes?**

  After you get crafting table, you can see the advancments in the menu.
  
  You can check out the craft recipes in the recipe book of the craft table.I suggest to install Just Enough Items to check out the rest recipes.

- **4.What's the differences between versions x.x.x.1 & x.x.x.0?**

    Currently Better Crafting Recipes support 1.21.2+ & 1.13-1.20.4, x.x.x.0 is the pack for 1.13-1.20.4, x.x.x.1 is the pack for 1.21.2-1.21.4, x.x.x.2 is the pack for 1.21.5+
  
    For compatibility, the root advancement icon is replaced to chest in x.x.x.0 version

    Due to the differences between different Minecraft versions ,not every feature in x.x.x.1 or x.x.x.2 can run properly in x.x.x.0 version
